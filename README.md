# LearnOpenGL
 My projects based on Joey de Vries' online material and tutorials for OpenGL https://learnopengl.com/
 
 The projects have been written in Qt Creator on a Linux system. 
 
 As per the instructions in the tutorial (see https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window):
 
 1. For rendering OpenGL context I use the GLFW library - built the library from its source repository https://github.com/glfw/glfw using cmake.
 2. I use GLAD (https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) as a Loader-Generator for OpenGL.
 
# Projects
- hello_world : Project demonstrating basic opengl commands on how to create an empty window with a background color.
- hello_triangle: Drawing triangles in a window using vertex and fragment shaders, Vertex Buffer (VBO) and Attribute (VAO) Objects.
- hello_rectangle: Drawing a rectangle using the Element Buffer Object (EBO) along with shaders, VBO and VAO.
